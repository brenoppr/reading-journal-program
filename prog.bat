ECHO Chapter 1: a "normal" day
ECHO Shane introduces himself and what a "normal day" in his family looks like. He lives with his parents, his brother and his two cats. It sounds pretty much what my family is like, even though he says his family's idea of normalcy should be really different than others' because of his disability.

ECHO Sure, there are some parts that wouldn't happen in the family of a non-disabled person, like his brother having to help him get out of bed for example, but nothing really unexpected for someone in his physical conditions is apparent in this first chapter.

ECHO Chapter 2: the lazy baby
ECHO Shane talks about his disease and his family`s reaction when they found out about his SMA. His parents were devastated with the idea of their children never being able to walk, but they came to accept it naturally. This is a really strong part of the book, and it shows Shane's family incredible willpower. It also is the chapter that features the most parts with technical information about Shane's disease.

ECHO Chapter 3: learning to drive
ECHO Shane tells us more about his different weelchairs and the problems he had with them. His chairs are really expensive, 28000 dollars according to him, which makes me think if he had been born in a poor family in Brazil he wouldn't have had the same privilege be able to afford such an expensive equipment.

ECHO Chapter 4: whoops
ECHO Shane talks about a regular summer day for him, playing with his friend Ben. He takes this opportunity to also talk about his struggles with going to the bathroom, and how he rather wait until he feels what he calls the "full bladder pain" to go to the bathroom. However, this often went wrong, as in the case of this chapter where he ends up peeing his pants.
ECHO This makes us think less about the macroscopic aspect of having a disability and more about how it might affects things you do daily and often go overlooked: in this case, going to the bathroom.

ECHO Chapter 11: slam dunk
ECHO Shane tell us about an episode from when he was in third grade. He, his brother and their friend Pat were playing basketball when of them threw around the idea of trying to dunk. They tried multiple setups for doing it, and the one they settled with consisted of, in his words, "tying a noose on one end of the rope for Shane's brother to lie in, looping the rope up over the basketball hoop and attaching the other end to his wheelchair".

ECHO Needless to say, it didn't work, but it shows how Shane is always trying to help out his friends, and just be normal even though his disability really does affect his capabilities of playing with his friends.

ECHO Chapter 15: cripple camp
ECHO In this chapter Shane talks about when he went to a camp for kids with muscular distrophy, and his problems with an attention grabbing kid called Tim when he was there. This chapter is one that really shows a lot about Shane's personality, and his social attitudes. Instead of just playing around with the kids at the camp, Shane rather spent time with the counselors who were closer to his level of maturity.
